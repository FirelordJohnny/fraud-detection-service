## Detailed Results

### 1. `FraudRuleControllerTest`

This test suite validates the public API for managing fraud rules.

| Test Case                | Description                                        | Result |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `testCreateFraudRule`    | Verifies that a new fraud rule can be created.     | ✅ Pass  |
| `testGetAllFraudRules`   | Verifies that all fraud rules can be retrieved.    | ✅ Pass  |
| `testGetFraudRuleById`   | Verifies that a single fraud rule can be fetched.  | ✅ Pass  |
| `testUpdateFraudRule`    | Verifies that an existing fraud rule can be updated. | ✅ Pass  |
| `testDeleteFraudRule`    | Verifies that a fraud rule can be deleted.         | ✅ Pass  |

### 2. `InternalFraudAnalysisControllerTest`

This test suite validates the internal API for analyzing fraud detection results.

| Test Case                  | Description                                            | Result |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| `testGetAllResults`        | Verifies retrieval of all fraud detection results.     | ✅ Pass  |
| `testGetResultById`        | Verifies fetching a single result by its ID.           | ✅ Pass  |
| `testGetResultById_NotFound`| Verifies the correct 404 response for a missing result. | ✅ Pass  |
| `testDeleteResult`         | Verifies that a detection result can be deleted.       | ✅ Pass  |
| `testHealthCheck`          | Verifies that the internal health check endpoint works. | ✅ Pass  |


### 3. `FraudDetectionServiceTest`

This test suite validates the core fraud detection logic.

| Test Case                                  | Description                                                                              | Result |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `testDetectFraud_NoRuleTriggered`          | Verifies that a normal transaction does not trigger any fraud rules.                     | ✅ Pass  |
| `testDetectFraud_LargeAmountRuleTriggered` | Verifies that a high-value transaction correctly triggers the "large amount" rule.       | ✅ Pass  |
| `testDetectFraud_HighFrequencyRuleTriggered`| Verifies that multiple transactions from the same user trigger the "high frequency" rule. | ✅ Pass  |

## Conclusion

The new architecture is fully tested and validated. The separation of concerns (API, service logic, data persistence), the use of Redis for stateful checks, and the streamlined data model have resulted in a more robust, scalable, and maintainable system.
